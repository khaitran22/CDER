# CDER - Collaborative Evidence Retrieval for DocRE
The source code for the ACIIDS'24 paper "[CDER: Collaborative Evidence Retrieval for Document-level Relation Extraction](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-97-4982-9_3)"
## Requirements
To install requirements:
```python
pip install requirements.txt
```
## Dataset
The [DocRED](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1074/) dataset used in our model can be downloaded following the instructions at [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owp7ZRbrMl_s1ljIh6AvnmniLJSliV6h?usp=sharing).
Noted that the dev.json file in the [public Github](https://github.com/thunlp/DocRED) has been modified in Aug, 2021. The modified version contains 998 documents. We use the original version of dev.json, which contains 1000 documents.

The expected structure of files is:
```
|-- CDER
  |-- dataset
    |-- docred
      |-- dev.json
      |-- test.json
      |-- train_annotated.json
      |-- train_distant.json
      |-- meta
        |-- rel2id.json
        |-- rel_info.json
```
## Training and Evaluation
Train CDER on DocRED with the following command:
```bash
>> sh scripts/train.sh
```
After training, testing CDER with the following command:
```bash
>> sh scripts/test.sh
```
Inferring CDER result to prepare for integrating to DocRE with the following command:
```bash
>> sh scripts/infer.sh
```
## DocRE result
We utilize the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/youmima/dreeam) for the DREEAM model to integrate the extracted evidence results from CDER. To reproduce the results, simply replace DREEAM's evidence output with the evidence results from CDER.
